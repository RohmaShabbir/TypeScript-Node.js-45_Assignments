The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly. */


// Define the function to create a car object

    const car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model,
        ...options  // Spread operator to include additional properties
    };

// Example usage
const myCar = createCar('Toyota', 'Corolla', { color: 'Black', sunroof: true });

// Print the car object to make sure all information is stored correctly
