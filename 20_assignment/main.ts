// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries : string[] = ["Pakistan" , "Dubai" , "Germany", "London" , "Japan"];

// Print list of countries
countries.forEach(country => {
    console.log(country);
    
})
